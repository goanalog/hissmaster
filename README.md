# Loop Portastudio

A browser-based instrument that merges a four-track inspired console with a dedicated loop-programming tape deck. Each track strip
introduces a different loop archetype while the central tape chamber renders the loop path, speed, and sonic character in real time.

## Getting started

Open `index.html` in any modern browser. No build tools or runtime required.
